What is it?
- Policies are the method in which collections of one or more RMM settings are applied to associated RMM objects such as devices.

Why is it important?
- The simple yet powerful way policies work helps VSA 10 overcome common challenges with RMM policy management implementations such as:
	- Overly complex configurations
	- Unintuitive user interface
	- Poor visibility
	- Overall lack of control over dynamic change

Each level of the **Organization** structure will display **Policies** that have been applied to that level, including each device level.

**Policies** can easily be reviewed for quick and complete visibility of their effective settings.


## Endpoint Policies

Endpoint policies are a series of settings that determine what level of access users can have on an endpoint.

Additionally, it can determine when notifications are sent for monitored services and performance metrics.

## Patch Management

VSA 10's **Patch Management** module offers the capability to create **Policies** to update the OS as well as 3rd party applications.

The main objective of patch management is to create a consistently configured environment that is secure against known vulnerabilities in the operating system and third-party applications.

_Please note: Patch Management policies can be applied at the Organization, Site, or Agent Group level._
