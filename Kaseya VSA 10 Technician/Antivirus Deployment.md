## Ransomware Detection
VSA 10’s Ransomware Detection functionality allows you to automatically detect if a ransomware attack has occurred on an agent. 

Additionally, this feature will also automatically isolate the infected system from the network in order not to cause any further harm to the network.

A VSA 10 Admin can:
1. Access the infected system.
2. Remote control into the infected system.
3. Remediate the infected system.
4. Shutdown the infected system to stop the attack.

When applying Ransomware Detection to your systems, please have the following in place:
1. Have a Ransomware Detection policy.
2. A Ransomware Detection license.

Server Admin > Configuration > Select an object > Edit > Add a Ransomware Detection policy

Endpoint protection > Policies > Create Ransomware Detection policy
