Profiles are the building blocks of Policies and make it simple to group settings based on different service level needs.

**Profiles** work like templates, making **Policies** and subsequent changes easier to manage.

**Policies** will only allow certain **Profiles** to be included.

**Policies** provide complete visibility of settings and impact, even before they are deployed.

Targeting is embedded directly into the Policy to eliminate challenges that often occur when relying on external dynamic device groupings.

**Policies** use **Targeting** and intelligence to deploy one or more **Profiles** to devices while preventing conflicts.

Designed to be either cumulative (ability to be layered) or non-cumulative (only one can be applied) to prevent conflicts.


## Policy Types
Policy types ensure that only one policy of a given type exists at any level of the organizational structure for optimal predictability.

## Targeting
Targeting provides the flexibility to ensure that only the relevant organizations, sites, groups, and devices receive the policy.


Monitoring and configuration profiles exist.
