- Documentation is incredibly important for:
	- Troubleshooting
	- Training new admins / technicians
	- Working with contractors and consultants
	- Compiling an asset inventory
- Documentation needs to give technical information in an easy to understand way.
- Network documentation should always have:
	- Floor plans
	- The network topology
	- Cable maps and rack diagrams
	- Network layer diagrams
	- IDF/MDF documentation
	- Server configuration
	- Network equipment
	- Network configuration, performance baselines, and key applications
	- Detailed account of network services
	- Wireless survey report
	- Audit and assessment report
	- SOPs and work instructions

# Wiring and Port Locations
- Network wiring schematics are important.
- Some are general, and some are very specific.
- Specific schematics need to be changed regularly.

- Port locations should be carefully recorded and included in the documentation as well.

## Troubleshooting Using Wiring Schematics
- Schematics that are present and up-to-date are important tools in troubleshooting network problems.

# Physical and Logical Network Diagrams
- Documentation should include diagrams of the physical and logical network design.
	- Physical topology: How it's physically constructed; how it looks
	- Logical topology: Refers to how the network functions. 
- Physical documentation of the network should include the following elements:
	- Cabling information
	- Servers
	- Network devices
	- WAN
	- User information

# Baseline / Golden Configurations
- Baseline: A measure of performance that indicates how hard the network is working and where network resources are spent.
	- This should be taken periodically.
- Baseline / golden configuration: An ideal configuration against which configurations from similar devices can be compared.
- Capturing: Collecting network statistics

# Policies, Procedures, Configurations, and Regulations

- Refers to an organization's documented rules about what is to be done, not done and why.
