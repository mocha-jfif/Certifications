# Components of Wiring Distribution
- The wiring closet is the place in the network where you connect the cables and networking devices. 
- These rooms contain key network devices, and they also contain the network media.

## Network Cross-Connects
- The cable that runs throughout a network can be divided into two distinct sections:
	- Horizontal cabling
	- Vertical (backbone) cabling
- There are three types of cable distribution:
	- Vertical (Main) cross-connect
	- Horizontal cross-connect
	- Intermediate cross-connect
- The term "cross-connect" refers to the point where the cables running throughout the network meet and are connected.
