5. You are an IT consultant who has been contracted to install new computers on a client's Gigabit Ethernet network. You want the performance of the new computers to be as good as it can be, so you configure their network adapters to run at the full speed of 1 Gbps and to use full-duplex communication. You test the computers after installing them, and they function well. However, once the computers are in service, you begin getting complaints from the client of extremely poor network performance on the new machines. You return to the site that evening and run some ping tests, but you do not detect any problem. You call in a colleague to perform a protocol analysis, and she detects large numbers of packet collisions,Â late collisions, cyclical redundancy check (CRC) errors, and runt frames. Which of the following could be the cause of the problem?
	1. Damaged cables
	2. Transmitter (TX)/receiver (RX) transposed
	3. Duplex mismatch
	4. Incorrect cable type

6. Which of the following is a wireless topology that does not require the use of an access point?
	1. Star
	2. Ad hoc
	3. Bus
	4. Infrastructure

7. You want to create a network in which computers from different departments are assigned to separate virtual local area networks (VLANs). You also want to be able to forward traffic between the VLANs so that each computer is capable of accessing any other computer. Which of the following will enable you to perform all these functions with a single device?
	1. Load balancer
	2. Virtual router
	3. Multilayer switch
	4. Broadband router

8. Which of the following are standard terms used in data loss prevention to describe specific data states? (Choose all that apply.)

10. You have been asked by your supervisor in the IT department to test some newly installed cable runs. She hands you the tool shown in the following figure. What is the function of the tool and how do you use it?![[Pasted image 20250217102919.png]]
	1. When you place the tool at one end of a wire, it generates a tone that can be detected at the other end.
	2. When you touch the end of the tool to a copper cable, you can detect and measure the electrical current flowing through it.
	3. When you connect the tool to the end of a fiber-optic cable, you can measure the length of the cable run.
	4. When you attach the tool to the end of a twisted-pair cable, it tests for crosstalk and other performance characteristics.

11. A multifactor authentication (MFA) system consists of at least two different identifying criteria, typically falling into two of the following categories: something you have, something you do, something you know, and something you are. Which of the following authentication factors is an example of something you have?
