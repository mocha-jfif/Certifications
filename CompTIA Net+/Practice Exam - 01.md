5. You are an IT consultant who has been contracted to install new computers on a client's Gigabit Ethernet network. You want the performance of the new computers to be as good as it can be, so you configure their network adapters to run at the full speed of 1 Gbps and to use full-duplex communication. You test the computers after installing them, and they function well. However, once the computers are in service, you begin getting complaints from the client of extremely poor network performance on the new machines. You return to the site that evening and run some ping tests, but you do not detect any problem. You call in a colleague to perform a protocol analysis, and she detects large numbers of packet collisions, late collisions, cyclical redundancy check (CRC) errors, and runt frames. Which of the following could be the cause of the problem?
	1. Damaged cables
	2. Transmitter (TX)/receiver (RX) transposed
	3. Duplex mismatch
	4. Incorrect cable type

6. Which of the following is a wireless topology that does not require the use of an access point?
	1. Star
	2. Ad hoc
	3. Bus
	4. Infrastructure

7. You want to create a network in which computers from different departments are assigned to separate virtual local area networks (VLANs). You also want to be able to forward traffic between the VLANs so that each computer is capable of accessing any other computer. Which of the following will enable you to perform all these functions with a single device?
	1. Load balancer
	2. Virtual router
	3. Multilayer switch
	4. Broadband router

8. Which of the following are standard terms used in data loss prevention to describe specific data states? (Choose all that apply.)

	2. Data at rest
	3. Data in transit

9. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is an encryption algorithm that was introduced in the Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) security protocol to replace another algorithm that was found to be easily penetrated. Which of the following encryption algorithms did AES replace?
	1. AES
	2. WEP
	3. WPA
	4. TKIP

10. You have been asked by your supervisor in the IT department to test some newly installed cable runs. She hands you the tool shown in the following figure. What is the function of the tool and how do you use it?![[Pasted image 20250217102919.png]]
	1. When you place the tool at one end of a wire, it generates a tone that can be detected at the other end.
	2. When you touch the end of the tool to a copper cable, you can detect and measure the electrical current flowing through it.
	3. When you connect the tool to the end of a fiber-optic cable, you can measure the length of the cable run.
	4. When you attach the tool to the end of a twisted-pair cable, it tests for crosstalk and other performance characteristics.

11. A multifactor authentication (MFA) system consists of at least two different identifying criteria, typically falling into two of the following categories: something you have, something you do, something you know, and something you are. Which of the following authentication factors is an example of something you have?
	1. A password
	2. A fingerprint
	3. A smartcard
	4. A finger gesture

12. Which of the following is a port number used for Structured Query Language (SQL) communications?
	1. 1433
	2. 3389
	3. 443
	4. 5060

13. At a clearance sale, you purchase some 802.11ac wireless network adapter cards for desktop computers at a very low price. Your plan is to use them to expand your 2.4 GHz 802.11n home network. After installing one of the adapters in a computer, you attempt to connect to the network, but you cannot see the SSID in the list of available networks. You try installing a different adapter, thinking the first one might be broken, but the second one does not work either. What can you do to resolve the problem and connect the computer to your network?
	1. Configure the network adapters to use the 2.4 GHz frequency.
	2. Move the computer closer to the access point.
	3. Manually enter the SSID in the computer's wireless network client software.
	4. Nothing. 802.11ac equipment cannot connect to a 2.4 GHz 802.11n network.

14. Which of the following mechanisms for the recovery from a disaster in a datacenter is the most expensive to implement?
	1. A hot site
	2. A warm site
	3. A cold site
	4. A cloud site

15. You are setting up an 802.11n wireless network using the 2.4 GHz frequency band. You plan to install three wireless access points. Which of the following channels should you use for your access points to avoid channel overlap that can result in interference? (Choose all that apply.)
	1. 1
	2. 4
	3. 6
	4. 8
	5. 11

16. Your supervisor has asked you to increase the security of the servers on your network. Which of the following procedures can be considered to be server hardening techniques? (Choose all that apply.)

	4. Disabling unused TCP and UDP ports

17. You are working the IT help desk when a user calls to report that he cannot access the Internet, although he is able to connect to computers on the local network. At the user's workstation, you run the `ipconfig /all` command and examine the output. Which of the options is the most likely explanation for the user's problem, based on the following `ipconfig` results? 
	1. DHCP is not enabled.
	2. The Subnet Mask setting is incorrect.
	3. The Default Gateway setting is incorrect.
	4. The DNS Servers setting is located on another network.
