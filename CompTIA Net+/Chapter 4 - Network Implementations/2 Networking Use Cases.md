# Software-Defined Networking
- SDN: Used to bypass the physical limitations of standard networking by using cloud architectures.
- Contains its own architecture, top to bottom:
	- [[Application layer]]
	- [[Control Layer]]
	- [[Infrastructure Layer]]
	- [[Management plane]]

# SDNs and the SD-WAN
- SD-WAN: An extension of the SDN that is commonly used in telco and data centers.
- Makes cloud computing available at the WAN level by adopting a virtual WAN architecture.
- Was evolved from MPLS and implements a central controller for managing the implementation.
- Transport agnostic.
- Application aware; can identify, classify, and prioritize network traffic based on the specific apps or services being used. 
	- Deep Packet Inspection
	- Application recognition
	- Dynamic policies and QoS
	- Path selection and routing optimization
	- Traffic steering and load balancing
	- Security and access controls
- Application awareness of SD-WAN allows organizations to optimize application performance, gain granular visibility and control, and improve network efficiency and security.
- Zero-touch provisioning
