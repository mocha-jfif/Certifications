# Throughput, Speed, and Distance
- There must be enough bandwidth to serve all users.
- Throughput is the rate of data delivery over a communication channel, measured in bpps.
- Bandwidth â‰  throughput

# Cabling Considerations
- Budgets don't always allow for the best cabling.
- If faulty wiring is the suspect, move the device or bring a known working device to test.
- A multifunction cable can help with troubleshooting most wiring issues.
- Bent pins can cause lack of contact.

# Cabling Issues
- An incorrect cable type can keep the host from being able to communicate on the network.
- A lower Cat rating than what is required.
- Using UTP where STP is required.

# Signal Degradation
- Weakening of a signal through fiber is called chromatic dispersion.
- Exceeding maximum distances without using repeaters.
- Measurement of attenuation is done in decibels, known as dB loss.

# Interference
- EMI and Crosstalk
- EMI can reduce or corrupt signal strengths.

# Improper Termination
- Can result in poor electrical contact between the cable and the connector.
- More suseptible to EMI and RFI.
- Can cause crosstalk.
- Causes signal loss, interference, reflections, physical damage, and increased error rates.

# Incorrect Pinout
- Try to keep cable splitting to a minimum.

# Bad Ports
- If a port is blocked, data will not be allowed through.
