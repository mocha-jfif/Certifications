# Broadband vs Baseband Transmissions
- Baseband uses digital signaling over a single wire; bidirectional, but sending and receiving cannot be simultaneous.
	- To send multiple signals on a single cable, it uses time-division multiplexing, which divides a single channel into time slots. Most networks use this baseband technology.
- Broadband uses analog, and the medium must be split into two channels or two cables.
	- Multiple channels are created using frequency-division multiplexing, which enables broadband to accommodate traffic going different directions on a single medium simultaneously.

# Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex
- Simplex: Enables one-way communication of data through the network, with the full bandwidth of the cable used for the transmission.
- Half-duplex: Accommodates transmitting and receiving on the network, but not at the same time.
- Full-duplex: Can simultaneously send and receive.
