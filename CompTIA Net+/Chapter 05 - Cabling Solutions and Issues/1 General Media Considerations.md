# Broadband vs Baseband Transmissions
- Baseband uses digital signaling over a single wire; bidirectional, but sending and receiving cannot be simultaneous.
	- To send multiple signals on a single cable, it uses time-division multiplexing, which divides a single channel into time slots. Most networks use this baseband technology.
- Broadband uses analog, and the medium must be split into two channels or two cables.
	- Multiple channels are created using frequency-division multiplexing, which enables broadband to accommodate traffic going different directions on a single medium simultaneously.

# Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex
- Simplex: Enables one-way communication of data through the network, with the full bandwidth of the cable used for the transmission.
- Half-duplex: Accommodates transmitting and receiving on the network, but not at the same time.
- Full-duplex: Can simultaneously send and receive.

# Data Transmission Rates
- Normally measured by the number of data bits that can traverse the medium in a single second; measured today in Mbps and Gbps.

# Wired v. Wireless
- A wireless network uses radio signals to transmit data between devices.
- Wired networks rely on physical cables.

# Cellular Technology Access
- GSM initially used TDMA to provide multiuser access by chopping up the channel into sequential time slices.
- TDMA was later replaced by DMA which uses different frequencies for each user to provide various means of coverage.
- Original GSM access with both TDMA and CDMA was 2G.
- 3G brought minor enhancements.
- 4G added the capability to implement mobile broadband.
- LTE was based on EDGE and HSMA technologies which increased the capacity and speed by using a different radio interface together with core network improvements.
- 5G brought faster speeds and met the needs of IoT devices.

# Satellite Access
- Used for wireless computer network access through satellite communication systems, which provide Internet connectivity to remote locations or areas where traditional wired infrastructure is unavailable or impractical.
- Operates using a two-way communication process: [[upstream]] and [[downstream]].

# Types of Network Media
- Two basic choices: copper and fiber-optic.

## Twisted-Pair Cabling (Copper)
- Originally created for voice transmissions, but now also used for networking. Two main types today:
	- UTP: More common than STP
	- STP: Used in environments where greater resistance to EMI and attenuation is required.
- Categories of TP cabling:
	- Cat 5: Operates at 100Mbps with a transmission range of 100 meters.
	- Cat 5e: Used on networks
