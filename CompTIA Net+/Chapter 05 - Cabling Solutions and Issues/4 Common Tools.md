# The Basic Tools
- Standard screwdrivers

# Cable Crimpers, Strippers, and Snips/Cutters
- Wire crimper: Used to attach media connectors to the end of cables.
- Strippers: Designed to cleanly remove sheathing
- Wire snips: Used to cleanly cut a cable.

# Punch-down Tools
- Used to attach twisted-pair network cable to connectors within a patch panel.

# Tone Generator
- Toner probe:
	- Tone generator: Sends the tone
	- Probe: Receives the tone signal

# Loopback Adapter
- Allows you to test a device / configuration / connectivity component using a dummy.

# TDR/OTDR
- Time-Domain Reflectometer (TDR): Used to send a signal through a particular medium to check the cable's continuity.
- Optical TDR: Used for fiber cables.

# Multimeter
- Tests for shorts in a length of coax, can also test TP with appropriate probes.
- Combines several electrical meters into a single unit that can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Advanced models can also measure temperature.
- Network multimeters also can:
	- Ping specific network devices
	- Verify network cabling
	- Locate and identify cable
	- Provide documentation

# Cable Tester
- A range of tools to test a cable's functionality.
- Media tester: Admins can test a segment of cable, looking for shorts, improperly attached connectors, or other cable faults.
- Line tester: Usually used to test telephone wiring.
- Cable certifier: Stress tests cables.

# Wire Map
- A test to see that all Ethernet wiring is correct and there are no opens, shorts, or wires reversed.

# Tap
- Used to connect drop cables to a distribution cable much like a splitter.
- A tap can apply a different amount of loss to each output path individually.

# Fusion Splicer
- Used to join two optical cables.

# Spectrum Analyzer
- Measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within the full frequency range of the instrument and can be used for a wide range of signals.

# Fiber Light Meter
- Measures the light moving through optical fiber to look for problems in a cable.
