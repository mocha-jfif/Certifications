# PoE Issues
- One common issue is exceeding the power budget.
- Another is when PoE devices are not compatible with the PoE standard supported by the network infrastructure.
# Transceiver Issues
- Mismatches occur when the transceivers used at either end of a network link are not compatible or do not support the same communication standards, data rates, and wave lengths.
